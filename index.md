## Download *Sports10* Dataset
We present a new dataset containing ***100,000 Gameplay Images*** of ***175 Video Games*** across ***10 Sports Genres***. The games are also divided into three visual styling categories: ***RETRO*** (arcade-style, 1990s and earlier), ***MODERN*** (roughly 2000s) and ***PHOTOREAL*** (roughly late 2010s).
