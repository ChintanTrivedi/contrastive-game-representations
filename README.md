### [IEEE CoG 2021 Paper]() | [*Sports10* Dataset](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/137Byy_ngEp_dFnzKpnCK1wxyzYxnhamE?usp=sharing) | [Pre-Trained Models]()

This repository is the official code implementation of the paper **"Contrastive Learning of Generalized Game Representations"** by [Chintan Trivedi](deepgamingai.com), [Antonios Liapis](http://antoniosliapis.com/) and [Georgios Yannakakis](https://yannakakis.net/).

## Installation
```
git clone git@github.com:ChintanTrivedi/contrastive-game-representations.git
cd contrastive-game-representations
pip install requirements.txt
```
Note that this code has been developed/tested with a single NVIDIA GPU using CUDA 10 and Tensorflow 2.3 on Windows platform. It is expected to work as-is on Linux/Colab platforms (untested).
